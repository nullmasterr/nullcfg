# nullcfg

The Latest Config of Null Master* (me)
    Counter-Strike : Global Offensive

Updated 08/10/2017

Copy nullcfg.cfg and autoexec.cfg into your CS:GO directory's cfg folder, possibly as follows:

"C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg"

Check nullcfg_guide.txt for the guide

- Buy binds guide is updated.
    - Both keypad and arrow-keys
   
- Mouse binds guide is updated.

autoexec.cfg

- autoexec.cfg is also uploaded.

Launch Options

-novid -nojoy -threads 6 +mat_queue_mode 2 -high

** -threads x   : x should be less than or equal to your amount of cores processor has.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
    You should always run the config file just after you start the game with opening console and type 'exec nullcfg' w/out aphostrophes.
    This is for consistency.
    
    You can also use this config along with the autoexec.cfg, just copy the nullcfg's script to autoexec.cfg, that would do it.
    By doing so, you no need to type 'exec nullcfg' all the time when you open up the game, but again for consistency I recommend you to
    use 'exec nullcfg' with nullcfg.cfg.
